# 100 Days of CODE

> This is to you, Kobe.

The 100 Days of CODE challenge is following a path specified in the [course syllabus from Udemy](Syllabus+for+100+Days+of+Python.pdf). It's a good practice to do a bit of coding every day to build muscle memory and to learn new things, with approximately one hour's time. Sometime it seems too easy, sometimes too hard, but either way, the efforts are worth it.
